In Jang book 
The strings command can be used to identify those daemons protected by TCP
Wrappers. It does so by listing the strings associated with various components of
binary files. The string associated with TCP Wrappers is hosts_access. Daemons can
be found in the /sbin and /usr/sbin directories. Thus, the quickest way to scan the
daemons in these directories for the host_access string is with the following commands:
# strings /sbin/* | grep hosts_access
# strings /usr/sbin/* | grep hosts_access
The output depends on installed packages. 
So I wanted to have a way to know what is the name of the package also.
Solution :
#!/bin/bash
for pckgname in /sbin/* /usr/sbin/* 
do
  strings $pckgname | grep hosts_access 
  controlval=$?  #if there was a match with pattern "hosts_access" , it will have a 0 value
  if [ "$controlval" == "0" ]
  then
    echo $pckgname  #these are the packages that have the string hosts_access somewhere
  fi
done
